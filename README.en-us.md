## Why?

I'm venezuelan and programming passionate me, we are in the middle of a global pandemic, and also, I like to watch the statistics about the COVID-19 situation in my country, I supposed that someone would like to watch it with a friendly UI; then I thought: "What if I do a Web App about this?", and yes, I did it (and I keep doing it by now). Also, I wanted to practice my skills with React and the UX/UI design, we all win!
